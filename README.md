# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This is a quick website I put together to show off my skills and creativity as a web developer. I designed it to be super colorful and make exploring my work less boring!

## Project Description

This website was created during the Christmas holidays to practice my web development skills. It includes:

- A list of my notable projects to date, with links to their source code or live versions.
- A contact form to reach me directly via email.
- Links to my professional social media profiles.

## Features
The website has a 'layers of the earth' theme, with each layer showcasing something else.
1. **Sky Layer:** Includes a weather API integration that dynamically displays weather conditions.
2. **Ground Layer:** Highlights my projects with links to their source code or live versions.
3. **Bedrock Layer:** Contains a contact form for reaching out to me via email.
